The purposes of this project are to predict tackling patterns using tracking data, so we should take a look at player positions and speeds at the time of contact in different situations. However, this notebook should provide with some insights on how to manipulate the tracking dataframes and calculate new variables such as Yards after contact. My next step will be further investigating play-by-play data, specifically positioning and speed of players when a tackle is made"
