This suggests that shorter players may have an advantage in breaking tackles or gaining yards as they are tackled, possibly due to their lower center of gravity and potentially higher strength.\n",

    "While this is good practice to get a feel for building models off of this kind of data, it would be more useful to attempt to predict individual play results, rather than player averages over 9 weeks of a season. The purposes of this project are to predict tackling patterns using tracking data, so we should take a look at player positions and speeds at the time of contact in different situations. However, this notebook should provide with some insights on how to manipulate the tracking dataframes and calculate new variables such as Yards after contact. My next step will be further investigating play-by-play data, specifically positioning and speed of players when a tackle is made"
